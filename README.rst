Rushlight: an emission modeling package to generate synthetic observational data from numerical models
===================================

*Rushlight* is a package to compute synthetic emissivities from physical parameters that are stored in 3D MHD/particle datasets to futher create synthetic images that can be compared with observations.
Currently availiable instruments are SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT.

These codes utilizes functionality provided by `yt <https://yt-project.org/>`_  and `sunpy <https://sunpy.org/>`_ packages.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
