#+TITLE: Rushlight: an emission modeling package to generate synthetic observational data from numerical models

* Aim
Compute synthetic emissivities from physical parameters that are stored in 3D MHD/particle datasets to futher create synthetic images that can be compared with observations.
Currently availiable instruments are SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT. 

These codes utilizes functionality provided by [[https://yt-project.org/][yt]] and [[https://sunpy.org/][sunpy]] packages.
