#+TITLE:Codes to model emission from 3d MHD and particle simulations datasets

* Aim
Compute synthetic emissivities from physical parameters that are stored in 3D MHD/particle datasets to further create synthetic images that can be compared with observations.
Currently availiable instruments are SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT. 

This code depends on [[https://yt-project.org/][yt]] and [[https://sunpy.org/][sunpy]] packages.
